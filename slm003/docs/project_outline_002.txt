Hi Claude,

I am developing a Python3 application with the help from AI.

I am developing it on an AMD64 Debian 12 Linux PC, that has no GPU.

I want to cross build it -- using docker buildx -- for an ARM64 Nvidia Jetson Nano, that has 4GB of Memory, a 64GB microSD card, and ONE Nvidia GPU.


The Nvidia box says:
Nvidia Maxwell GPU, Quad Core ARM Cortex-A57 Processor, and 4GB LPDDR4 Memory.
Nvidia JetPack Software is flashed to the microSD card.
Apparently, the JetPack is based on Ubuntu 18.04 (and it should not be updated to a newer ubuntu version, because the NVIDIA specific pieces of software might stop working.)

I want to build the application and the docker image on my Debian 12 PC -- for both architectures -- using docker buildx.

I want to use the following base image: nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-ml

For Machine Learning in this situation, I have been told, this is the best choice.

I hope that is correct.

I want to upload the image to Docker Hub.

I want to pull ARM64 image from Docker Hub and -- using nvidia-docker -- run it on the ARM64 Nvidia Jetson Nano, that has one GPU.

I have also installed ollama, and I am running ollama serve.

I have pulled gemma2 using ollama, and I want to use this model as a chatbot.

Interactive shell:

nvidia-docker run -it gemma2 .... etc

What is the application going to do? Right now, I just want to chat with it.

Ollama is already installed on both systems.

Ollama will be outside the container and be mounted from --host

nvidia-docker/nvidia-container-runtime. How can I know, if this is already installed on the Jetson?

I agree wit your suggestion:   - Multi-stage build to reduce final image size

As for the choice of the base image:

Let us first try:

nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-ml:r35.2.1-py3

But we will later modify the code, if we see, that it does not run on the Jetson.

I have tested Ollama with Gemma2 on the Jetson directly. It work, although a littler slower than my PC. However, I DO NOT KNOW, if ollama uses the GPU or not!!

You said: The chatbot connects to `localhost:11434` - in a containerized environment, this needs to be adjusted for container networking. Please fix it. Thanks.

I prefer (Option B:) a lightweight container that connects to host-based Ollama
