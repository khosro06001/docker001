BUILD DOCKER CONTAINER:

docker build -t slm001-enhanced .

TEST WITH BETTER MODEL:

docker run -it --rm -v slm001-cache:/app/cache slm001-enhanced

(I used number 2: best)

docker build -t slm001-enhanced .

The above command only creates an image than runs on my Debian 12 PC, running amd64.

But, I want to also run this on my Jetson Nano (4GB memory), that has an arm64 CPU (and not amd64).

So I guess must cross-build for 2 architectures.

What are the command lines for those?
