To download and use nvidia-docker on Debian, you'll need to install
the NVIDIA Container Toolkit after installing Docker and NVIDIA
drivers. The toolkit includes the necessary tools and configurations
to enable GPU support within Docker containers.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Install Docker:

    Follow the official Docker documentation for Debian to install Docker Engine.
    This typically involves adding the Docker repository, installing the necessary packages, and starting the Docker service. 

2. Install NVIDIA Drivers:

    Install the appropriate NVIDIA drivers for your system. You can do this using your distribution's package manager (e.g., apt).
    For example, on Debian, you can use sudo apt install nvidia-driver nvidia-smi nvidia-driver.



    You may need to reboot your system after installing the drivers.
    You can verify the installation by running nvidia-smi. 

3. Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit:
Add the NVIDIA repository.
