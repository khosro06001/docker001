Hi Claude,

I am developing a Python3 application with the help from AI.
I am developing it on the AMD64 PC, that has no GPU.
Using docker buildx.
Uploading to Docker Hub.
Pulling from and running on ARM64 Jetson Nano, that has a GPU, using nvidia-docker.

===

I want to use the following base image:

nvcr.io/nvidia/l4t-ml

for Machine Learning 

===
Application:

Image captioning. 

===
===
===

I have an ARM64 Nvidia Jetson Nano 4GB memory, 64 GB microSD card.IMPORTANTLY it has ONE GPU.
The box says:
NVIDIA Maxwell GPU, Quad Core ARM Cortex-A57 Processor, and 4GB LPDDR4 Memory
Nvidia JetPack Software is installed on the microSD card.
Apparently, it is based on Ubuntu 18.04, and it should not be updated to a newer ubuntu version, because the NVIDIA specific pieces of software might stop working.

I have a AMD64 Linux Debian 12 PC at home, with NO*** GPU:

The image captioning application that will run on the ARM64 Jetson Nano (using nvidia-docker --gpus all) must use a 4-bit-QUANTIZED VERSION of this model:

MiniCPM-V

===

Later I am intending to also try a quantized version of:

Llama-3-VILA1.5-3B

LlaVa-1.5-7B

Llama-3-VILA1.5-8B


===

Input method: we will specify the path to the image on the command line as an argument


===
We will write and puild on the Debian 12 AMD64 PC.

docker buildx needs to build it for both architectures: AMD64 and ARM64

===

You suggested:


    Memory Management: Given the Jetson Nano's 4GB memory limit, I suggest implementing memory monitoring and possibly using model sharding or offloading techniques.
    Multi-stage Docker Build: Use a multi-stage build to keep the final image size smaller.
    Health Checks: Add Docker health checks to ensure the application is running properly.
    Logging: Include proper logging for debugging on the Jetson Nano.
    Graceful Degradation: Add fallback mechanisms if GPU memory is insufficient.
    Model Caching: Cache the downloaded model to avoid re-downloading on container restarts.

I agree with all.




===

CAN YOU PLEASE WRITE:

1- the python script (vlm001.py)
2- script-to-tes-the-python-locally-on-Debian-PC.sh
3- the Dockerfile
4- script-to-buildx-and-deploy-to-ducker-hub.sh
5- script-to-pull-and-run-on-the-Jetson-Nano.sh


===

And whatever else, you think is necessary.

Before writing the code, however, if any items are unclear, pleas ask me.

If you would suggest modifications, please tell me + your reasons for the modification.

After that, we will finalize the plan, and then finally write the code.

Thank you, Claude!
